        <p>Before, I had no idea what javascript was. 
            Brendan Eich, while working at Netscape, purportedly invented JavaScript in only ten days in May 1995. 
            After Netscape creator Marc Andreessen, it was initially called Mocha but was renamed LiveScript four months later. 
            Sun Microsystems held the JavaScript trademark at the time. 
            In December 1995, Netscape purchased a trademark license and changed LiveScript to JavaScript. 
            The languages have nothing in common. Between 1996 and 1997, Netscape took JavaScript to the Ecma standards group to carve out and maintain a specification for the language so that other browser makers may implement it based on their work. 
            The Ecma Technical Committee 39 was formed to continue the evolution of the language, which resulted in the release of ECMA-262 Ed.1 in June 1997. 
            The official standard is called ECMAScript, and JavaScript is the most well-known implementation of the bar. 
            Other deployments include ActionScript and JScript.
            <br><br>
            It became synonymous with web development, and with dozens of frameworks in place today to meet all of our needs, we have gone a long way. 
            I discovered that there are several published resources in Javascript, and that they are continuously developing
             enhancements so that developers may use it conveniently. It also made me realize how wonderful this ecmascript is, 
            and how many amazing things people can utilize right now as a result of it.
            <br><br>
            Javascript, until now, is really one of the importan programming language in the world and I agree that it is the same as the other language and it is more popular.
